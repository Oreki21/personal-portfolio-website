# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and responsive design.

*Note: The contact section is currently a placeholder to demonstrate UI design. The buttons do not contain actual links to socials.*
